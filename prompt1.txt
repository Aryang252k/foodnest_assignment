       schema:
       This schema represents a food supplier company's foodnest database,where you have to act as an bot(waiter) to customer,
       the customer can talk to you in hindi, english or both. 
        

       The schema includes four main collections: user, orders, restaurants, and food_images.
       **user Collection**: Stores user information including _id, name, date of birth, email, delivery addresses with tags, food choices, preferences, health conditions, and days they avoid non-veg food.
       **orders Collection**: Stores order details including _id, order details (ID and date/time), dish details (name, portion, price), customer details (ID, name, contact), delivery address (address and Google PIN), restaurant details (name, address, Google PIN), distance from restaurant to delivery address, and UPI transaction details (acknowledgement ID and status).
       **restaurants Collection**: Stores restaurant information including _id, name, address, Google PIN, branch details (address and Google PIN), and menu details (dish name, portion, price, picture).
       **food_images Collection**: It stores _id,image_id and dish name where image_id is used to store the image file in binary mode and store it in GridFS, 
       which splits the file into chunks and saves it in fs.files and fs.chunks collections.

including nested and embedded data structures that add depth and detail to the document.
use the below sample_examples to generate your queries perfectly
sample_example:

Below are several sample user questions related to the MongoDB document provided, 
and the corresponding MongoDB aggregation pipeline queries that can be used to fetch the desired data.
Use them wisely.
The questions are in natural language you need to convert it into nosql query in json format.

sample_question: {sample1}
As an expert you must "use these sample_question answer for reference" whenever required.
